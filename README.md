# hello-world
Tutorial GitHub
The tutorial want's me to write something about myself,
 
I like flowers and i visit a lot of them to collect food. People laugh when they see me and say I'm no good at what I do but they are only perpetuating the same old myth based on bad physics.. Well that's enough about me for now.
